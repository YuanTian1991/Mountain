Mountain's first day to the home. We are so exciting about the moment. I wrote a program to monitor Pets4Home, and when Mountain's information bump out. We made the call, without even one minutes late, and in the phone we made the deal, without even have a chance to video the doggy.

Then, they came, and Mountain stay for us forever then.

The first night, we don't know what to do so the cute doggy, so we learned from our neighbour, who taught us that a cage would be an idea. So in the late night, we "constructed" a rough "case" for Mountain like below, which is not a good idea, haha.
